# What To Watch

Welcome to What To Watch, a movie recommender!  Created from a large base of movie ratings data obtained from Movie Lens data sets, available at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/, What To Watch offers users movie suggestions based on top recommended movies, movies you haven't seen, and movies custom recommended for you based on similarities in viewing taste between you and other users. 

## Let's Go!

Clone/download the repository and from the same level in the directory structure as the movie_lib.py file, enter the following in the command line:
```
python3 movie_lib.py
```
From there, follow the prompts to interact with the app.
